bio: |
  Alex Cassem is a PhD candidate at Tufts University in the Institute of Cosmology. His research interests include inflation,
  cosmological collider and boostrap, gravitational effective field theories (EFTs) and LSS, and constraining EFTs with
  fundamental principles in consulation with observational data. Alex is also passionate about teaching and education, 
  especially for those who are underrepresented in physics, and did not have the opprtunity to learn physics in their early life.
